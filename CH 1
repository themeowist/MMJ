The meow that can be meowed
is not the eternal Meow.
The mewl that can be mewled
merely whispers of the true mewl.

the wordless purr forever resonates.
Purring creates all things from no things.

Patient cat, encounters the shape of the cat dimension.
Frisky cat, only catches mundanity of daily day.

Yet cat dimension and mundanity arise from the same source,
the resonant purr. The deepest rumbly purr.

Purring within purring.
The threshold to all comforting snuggles.
