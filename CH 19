Stahhp doing stuff like how "wat wuld ceiling cat do" and "basement cat be liek".
Kitty life gets 100x better without dis!

Stahhp putting out lofty behaviour like altruisticness and rightness
so that all kitty harmony can really be nurtured.

Stahhp murky mental maneuvers (but not cat physics calculations, that's fine)
and then we won't have thieves and deceivers.

Just be true, unadorned cat.
Don't get fiddly with the outside bits and pieces.

"Need little,
want less.
Forget the rules.
Be untroubled."
