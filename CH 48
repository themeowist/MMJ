For the Hunt and the reward of noms,
kitteh makes zoomies every day.
Zoomies for noms, zoomies for noms.
But to pursue the way of Meow,
kitteh unlearns the chase of reward
a little every day.

Less Hunt but not less zoomies.
Less Hunt but not less noms.
Less Hunt, less effort, less force,
begets Cat. Of non-action. "Mew mei."**
When nothing is done,
nothing is left undone.

Full Cat* becomes unleashed
in the absence of striving.
Release the natural order.
You don't find Meow by Hunting.

*footnote: Cat is pronouced "cat with a capital c"
** footnote: non-action, the meowist "mew mei" is also the daoist "wu wei"
