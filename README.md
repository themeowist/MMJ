# Meow Meh Jing, aka The Book of Meow

The project originates from The Meowist, http://laurenlau.com/meow-meh-jing.  We're interpreting the Book of Dao into the Book of Meow.

This is our [reference list](https://github.com/themeowist/MMJ/blob/master/RESOURCES) of consulted works.  In each chapter of the MMJ, we indicate which resources have influenced the meowoning of that chapter.

Future projects include
- The LOLcat Meow Meh Jing
- The LOLcat Yijing, a primer
